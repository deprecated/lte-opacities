* LTE opacities from Cloudy
We want an independent test to compare with the graphs in Gray
** Relevant test cases 
+ The manual shows a lot of places that LTE can be turned on.  I will look at Cloudy's test cases to see if I can find something relevant
+ We could just let it find LTE on its own, without forcing it.  An example of this would be something like [[file:~/Work/CLOUDY/cloudy/tsuite/auto/limit_lte_hminus.in]]
** First experiments with my own models
** Treatment of H^{-} ion 
+ Comprehensive treatment in hazy3, section 4.5
  + But note that Fig 4.3 is wrong - it is a repeat of the H^0 lines graph
  + Problem is down to [[file:~/Work/CLOUDY/cloudy/docs/latex/hazy3/Hmi_vs_density.TAB][docs/latex/hazy3/Hmi_vs_density.TAB]] being the wrong data, I think
  + It should be like lower panel of Fig 9 in Ferland & Persson 1989

This one should reach LTE by hard work

And this one should have it forced upon it

Now try one with a larger number of resolved levels
