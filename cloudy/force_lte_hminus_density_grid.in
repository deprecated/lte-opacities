# commands controlling continuum =========
# this is a second way to get STE and tests the energy density option
blackbody 5000 energy density 5000K

# commands for density & abundances =========
hden 10 vary
grid 8 16 0.5
init "hheonly.ini"
# Default abundance set has no grains
#
# commands controlling geometry  =========
stop zone 1
set dr 0
#
# other commands for details     =========
iterate

# Commands to FORCE lte (does this work?)
species "H" lte

## H2 rate coef, much larger than before

This checks that the negative hydrogen ion goes
to thermodynamic equilibrium when irradiated by
a blackbody in thermodynamic equlibrium.  It was
originally presented in
